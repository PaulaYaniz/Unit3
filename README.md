## Criteria A: Planning
### Problem definition
My client is a student at a local school. After meeting with her (see Appendix A) I learned that very Monday morning at her advisory, she fills out the Komodo survey, a survey that checks the students' wellbeing at her school. However, she feels like the survey has too many questions, it is sometimes not accurate enough, and it does not allow her to express all her feelings. She would like to write a personal diary, but as she lives with 3 roommates, she thinks she would not have enough privacy. She would like to be able to write about her feelings every day, and then to have a way to organize the writings by category, according to what she is talking about. My client needs a cost effective, efficient, and more private way to track her emotions and write about them. 

#### Design statement
I will design and make an application for writing a mood diary for a client who is a student at UWC ISAK Japan. The program will consist on an application for being able to keep track of her mood every day, plus being able to write some notes and having them organized by feeling. It is constructed using the softwares Python, Kivy, and SQLite. It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A, B, C, and D.

### Rationale for proposed solution
OOP is the programming paradigm.The application will have a sign up and login system with encrypted password, to increase security. The application will be minimalistic and simple for it to be user-friendly. Once the user has passed the login system, a main menu will appear. There, user will be able to select and emotion and write how she is feeling. She can also access past notes organised in folders by emotion. The tools I am using for this are Python, Kivy, and SQL.
I chose Python because  its codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages[^1]. Python is an open source and has a lot of libraries to complement the code[^2], so there are multiple options of personalisation for fulfilling the client's necessities. Python is also good for the client, as it is free and my client will not need to buy a license[^3].
I chose Kivy because it is also free and convenient for the client, as it can run in many platforms. Kivy is fresh, fast, flexible, and focused. If the client needed to sell her application in the future, doing that would be completely free and she would not have to pay anything to Kivy. [^4]
I chose SQLite because it is an easy and simple way to look and get all data. SQLite is lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate in Python applications.  It does not require a separate server process or system, and data can be stored in a single file, making it easy to manage. The use of Client/Server RDBMS would had been necessary for a high volume website, client/server app, very large databases, and high concurrency of simultaneous readers. [^5] As my app does not have data separated from app by the networks, concurrent writers, or very big data, SQLite is a good option that will meet the client’s requirements.
Overall, the combination of Python, Kivy, and SQLite provides a cost-effective, efficient, and user-friendly solution to the client's needs for a mood tracker application.

### Success criteria:
After meeting with the client ans sending her an email (See Appendix B), we agreed the following success criteria:
1. There is a secure registration and login system with requirements for password and email.
2. The application will contain a page asking how the client is feeling, to which the client will only be able to answer selecting one of the options given.
3. After selecting the feeling, the customer will be able to write notes about it.
4. The notes will be grouped in folders by the adjectives, and will have a date.
5. The application will allow the client to delete and add notes.
6. The application will give statistical information about the user's well-being: number of positive and negative emotions felt.

# Criterion C

***Here you basically copied some parts of the code related to the criteria. This is good but not sufficient.  You can improve this section by adding a technical description of some of your code to show knowledge.  Also, we want to read here your thinking and rational to solve the client's requirements. "The way I solve this requirements was..."

### Code

***Explain each part: you can improve this part by describing the code in more detail so that you can show your knowledge of computer programming and algorithms. At this point you are just mentioning what the code is intended to do without how it does it. An example of a description is Quiz033.
Why this code is good, why i chose it and how helps the client, gpt
